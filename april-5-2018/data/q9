6 Peer review/pair programming


platform and arcitecture are always key -- what are we using moslty also interested in dedicated h/w and mobile embedded ml
Put out a hitlist, like updating HLearn
Consider sprints or focus sessions at e.g. ICFP.
Not sure about a prelude. Subhask looked awesome but went nowhere.
My company doesnâ€™t allow me to contribute
bite-sized bugs, lists of simple open/missing libraries or methods that should be ported from other langs
DataHaskell NixOS Jupyterlab Server Configuration (I am working on this)
An actual motivated effort to make a world class ND array library.
monetary compensation in some form.
The more it seems the project will live on and be real-world usable, the more likely I am to start using and contributing.
